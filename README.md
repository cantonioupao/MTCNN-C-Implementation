# MTCNN-C-Implementation
These are 2 different implementation of MTCNN in C. The code was generated using CubeAI and the source project is built on KeiluVision5. The 3 CNN model architectures and model weights initially generated by CubeAI can be found under "Src".For instance for Onet, you can find the model architecture at 'onet.c' and the weights at 'onet_data.c'.The full implementation is show above and can be directly accessed through openinng the project "Full_Implementation" or "Full Implementation Method2_12_12" depending on whether you prefer to use an MTCNN with a Pnet input size of (27,27,3) or (12,12,3).
